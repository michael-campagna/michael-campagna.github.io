      <h1>A visual introduction to magnetic coordinate systems</h1>
      </center>
      <p>
        In my path to a better understanding of the various magnetic coordinate systems which exist
        to study magnetic confinement concepts, I thought it might be helpful to produce a visual guide.
        This exposition closely follows, and intends to supplement, those found in [1, 2], and assumes
        some familiarity with linear algebra and vector calculus.

      <h2>Coordinate systems in $\mathbb{R}^3$</h2>
      <p>
        A coordinate system $\mathcal{C}=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ provides a method to parameterize a point $\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^3$.
        For such a coordinate system, there exists a bijective function $\mathcal{R}$ such that $\mathbf{r}=\mathcal{R}(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. 
        It follows that for any function $f$ over $\mathbb{R}^3$ there exists a function $f_\mathcal{C} = f \circ \mathcal{R}$
        such that $f(\mathbf{r}) = f_\mathcal{C}(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. Note that if $f$ represents a physical quantity, we often do not make
        the distinction between $f$ and $f_\mathcal{C}$, and simply write $f$-- the coordinate system being used is typically
        understood from context. Note also that each of our coordinates
        $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ can be individually cast as a functional on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, the toroidal setting of most magnetic confinement configurations is naturally parameterized by
        cylindrical coordinates $(\rho, \phi, z)$.

      <p>
        The coordinates are the weights to the three orthogonal basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat \rho}$, $\boldsymbol{\hat \phi}$,
        $\mathbf{\hat z}$, so we have for any vector $\mathbf{v}$ some decomposition
        $$ \mathbf{v} = v_\rho \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + v_\phi \boldsymbol{\hat \phi} + v_z \mathbf{\hat z}, $$
        and in particular for our position vector
        $$ \mathbf{r} = \rho \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + z \mathbf{\hat z}. $$
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also think of the coordinates as what they physically represent, which is best understood by their functional forms
        $$\rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
        $$\tan\phi = y/x$$
        $$z=z$$
        where $\phi$ is defined implicitly for ease of interpretation. But how do we get from these coordinates to our basis vectors?
        Consider the quantity $\nabla \rho$. The gradient will always point in the direction of greatest increase of the function $\rho$.
        If we move a certain distance in any direction, the direction we must go in order to maximize the increase of $\rho$ must be along the
        direction where only $\rho$ changes-- we should expect that $\nabla \rho \propto \boldsymbol{\hat\rho}$. Since 
        $|\boldsymbol{\hat \rho}| = 1$, this forces $$\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} = \frac{\nabla \rho}{|\nabla \rho|},$$ and in fact, this type 
        of relationship between a set of basis vectors and coordinate functionals generalizes to most coordinate systems of practical 
        interest.
